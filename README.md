# Color Picker App

###  This is a React project I developed to improve my React skills.
###  [This](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/learn/lecture/14376568#overview) course guided me in this project. Got support when I got stuck writing my own codes
###  I also used it in some utility packages and libraries.
